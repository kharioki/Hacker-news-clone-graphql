**GraphQL** is an API standard that provide more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST.

> It enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data they need and GraphQL will fetch the data for them. It exposes a single any endpoint instead of multiple endpoints and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.

**Is GraphQL a database technology?**
No. It is a query language for APIs not databases.
It is database agnostic and effectively can be used in any context where an API is used.
